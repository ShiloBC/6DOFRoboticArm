# 6-DOF Robotic Arm â€“ Kinematics and Dynamics

This MATLAB project focuses on the **kinematic and dynamic modeling** of a robotic manipulator with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) composed of revolute joints. It includes computation of transformation matrices using Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) parameters, Jacobian matrix analysis, and an analytical calculation of the static torques required at each joint to hold a payload at the end-effector.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Forward kinematics using standard DH parameters
- Homogeneous transformation matrices between coordinate frames
- Jacobian matrix computation for mapping joint velocities to end-effector velocities
- Static torque calculation based on gravity and a given payload at the end-effector
- Modular MATLAB functions for ease of extension and experimentation
