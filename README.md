# 6-DOF Robotic Arm â€“ Kinematics and Dynamics

This MATLAB project focuses on the **kinematic and dynamic modeling** of a robotic manipulator with six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) composed of revolute joints. It includes computation of transformation matrices using Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) parameters, Jacobian matrix analysis, and an analytical calculation of the static torques required at each joint to hold a payload at the end-effector.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Forward kinematics using standard Denavitâ€“Hartenberg (DH) parameters
- Inverse kinematics using analytical solutions based on arm geometry and desired end-effector pose (position + orientation)
- Trajectory generation between two 3D poses, including linear interpolation with time-based acceleration/deceleration profiles
- Smooth motion planning, minimizing abrupt joint movements using continuity-aware selection of inverse kinematics solutions

Dynamic modeling:
- Homogeneous transformation matrices between coordinate frames
- Jacobian matrix computation for mapping joint velocities to end-effector velocities
- Static torque calculation for holding a payload against gravity at the end-effector
- Real-time animation of the robotic arm motion in 3D space using MATLAB graphics
- Modular MATLAB functions for ease of testing, visualization, and extension
